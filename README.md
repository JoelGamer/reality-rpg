# reality-rpg
It's a project/game developed using Ruby on Rails, React and React Native

Currenty there is only Rails, first I want to develop the game logic (Bussness Logic :p), then I'll get in to the beauty part of things, like UI, web pages, etc etc...

For now, I'm just going to use this project for developing my skills, using what I'm learning and what I'll learn while developing this project, as well as maintaing
some sort of a clean code, not just going to paste whatever thing that I see throughout the internet, I'll keep it clean, for those o wish to adventure on this code.

Enough rambling, let's get coding!
